# Cipher and Encryptions

This project allows encryption and decryption with caesar ciphers, random substitution ciphers, vigenere ciphers, and RSA encryption. This program was written as a part of CS 2112 (fall 2020) at Cornell University. Due to academic intergrity concerns, I am unable to publicly publish the full repository of thie project. I, instead, posted a jar file of the project. To view the full contents of the code, please email fan123.me@gmail.com for requests. 

# How to run the program

The user should be able to provide commands of the following form via the console:
```
java -jar <YOUR_JAR> <CIPHER_TYPE> <CIPHER_FUNCTION> <OUTPUT_OPTIONS>
```
